--------------------------- INSTALLATION ---------------------------

There is not a fancy installation program for this CD; it does not need 
one.  Read through the contents below and copy onto your system such 
files from the CD as seem interesting to you. 

----------------------------- CONTENTS -----------------------------

This CD has the following directories:

\CODE
    \TANKCODE
      This directory contains all of the files you need to build 
      the underground tank monitoring system discussed in the 
      text.  Both source and object files are included, as well 
      as copies of the relevant uC/OS files.  The project file 
      UNDRGRND.PRJ is a Borland project file that will build the 
      system.  The only change you should have to make in the
      project is that under the Options dropdown menu, under
      Directories, you must change the 'library' and 'include'
      directories to reflect the location at which you have
      installed the compiler.

      When you run UNDRGRND.EXE, you should expand your DOS window
      to fill the whole screen.  Otherwise, the mechanisms in 
      Windows that display the DOS window will make the program
      appear to run irregularly.  You can make your DOS window
      fill the screen by holding down the ALT key and pressing the
      ENTER key.  (You can shrink your DOS window back by pressing
      the same key combination a second time.)
      
    \UCOSV111
      The various subdirectories of this contain version 1.11 of 
      the uC/OS operating system.  The files READ.ME and UCOS.LST 
      on that directory contain more information about uC/OS.   
      The file UCOSLIC.DOC contains licensing information about 
      uC/OS.
      
\ANSWERS
      This directory contains answers to selected problems in the text 
      in PDF format.

\ACROBAT
      This directory contains Adobe Acrobat Reader software for a
      variety of platforms.
